# Snake Game

A classic Snake game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — all in a single file. No setup or dependencies required.

## How to Play

1. Open `index.html` in your browser
2. Use **arrow keys** to move the snake
3. Eat the red dots to grow and score points
4. Avoid hitting the walls or yourself

On touch devices, use the on-screen buttons to control the snake.

## Settings

You can tweak these values at the top of the `<script>` section in `index.html`:

| Setting     | Description                          | Default |
|-------------|--------------------------------------|---------|
| `GRID_SIZE` | Number of cells per row/column       | 20      |
| `TILE`      | Pixel size of each cell              | 20      |
| `SPEED`     | Milliseconds between moves (lower = faster) | 120 |
